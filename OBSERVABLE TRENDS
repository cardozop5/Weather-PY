From the plots we can observe that tempereture of a city increases or perhaps becomes hotter the closer it is to the equator.
Surprisingly a huge percentage of the cities have humidity greater than 50%. There isn't any correlation between Humidity and the degree of Latitude based on the plots.
The wind speed of most of the cities stayed below 10Mph. there isnt any correlation between wind speed and the degree of latitude based on the plots as well
